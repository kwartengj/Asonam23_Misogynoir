I don't think Mr. Tory Boy read the paper either. It would be easier to interpret his tweet as misogynoir if he somehow attempted to imply that she wrote a ""bad"" paper, or that she couldn't possibly write a good paper, BECAUSE she is a black women. One can only assume whether or not he attempted to make such an implication, even if it's clear that the comment is made in bad faith. But to go to the extent of dissecting every possible mischievous meaning behind such a comment quickly becomes a waste of time and effort. There is, possibly, a racist and, most definitely, sexist element in the comment. If anything, more misogyny than misogynoir because Mr. Tory appears to be the sort of person who could have written this tweet to any other women that he perceives to be ""playing"" the role of a ""victim"" for whatever reason (skin color, sexual orientation, wage gap, etc...).","Link to the tweet and external resources,Further detail of the tweet (user accounts, followers, user bio, tweet thread)",,,Unclear,Not confident at all,"Could be misogynoir if the user is just assuming that she was engaging in victim behavior toxicity, but then again... many possible interpretations.

There is still room for interpretation, which doesn't necessarily involve this person having a condescending attitude or prejudice towards black women. Unwise and rude as this tweet may seem, one can only assume about its intent. Or one can choose to interpret it a certain way without assessing all the facts (which is the position I'm put in as a participant of this study). If a black woman interprets this as misogynoir, I'm not the one to tell her otherwise. But as someone who sees it from an ""outside"" perspective, I can see that her judgement may not be entirely free of bias either. It doesn't help that this type of comment/tweet is also made to many other, again, ""victim"" demographics in spaces obsessed with ""culture wars"". The whole rhetoric around these issues has become so convoluted and unwise that it's often unclear where some form of harassment/discrimination begins and ends. If I'm sounding too academic, yes, I agree that it looks like an instance of misogynoir, but I don't like (nor do I care) to pass judgement based on just looks.",Unclear,Slightly confident,"Not sure, but this person definitely seems to have something against Timnit.
